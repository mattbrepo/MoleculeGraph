# MoleculeGraph
Molecule Graph test using Kamada-Kawai and Fruchterman-Reingold algorithms.

**Language: R**

**Start: 2019**

## Why
I wanted to test the result of the [Kamada-Kawai](https://doi.org/10.1016/0020-0190(89)90102-6) algorithm to draw molecules like the [Buckminsterfullerene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene). The result is compared with the original SDF coordinates and with the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm. Both algorithms are offered by [igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html) R package.
